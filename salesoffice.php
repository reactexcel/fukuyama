         <p>For today's business, developed logistics is more than a matter of moving goods around; it is a vital means
            of communication.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>Whereas previously speed and price alone were all that mattered, today's just-in- time delivery also demands
            just the right volume. Constantly looking ahead, Fukuyama Transporting has built a national sales network
            finely tuned to the changing needs of its customers. The network comprises 400 sales offices covering the
            length and breadth of the country from Hokkaido in the north to Okinawa in the south. The company also has
            extensive international coverage with its courier and air cargo service reaching 184 countries, and is steadily
            developing its ocean freight network.
