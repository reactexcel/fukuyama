            Fukuyama Transporting Co Ltd, 'peared' up with Tokyo Metropolitan Police to promote safe driving by handing out pears at a street crossing in Etchujima, Tokyo. The event involved creative word play, as the sound 'nashi' in Japanese means both 'pear' and 'none'. Drivers were asked to enjoy the pears and aim to bring accident numbers in the metropolis down to 'none'. This is another sign of a trend for large Japanese corporations to cast aside their traditional serious image for a moment to practice corporate responsibility in a fun and memorable manner. In the past year Fukuyama Transporting has had 'nashi' traffic accidents and will strive to keep it at 'nashi'. 
            <br><br>
            At the 'nashi' event Fukuyama Transporting President and C.E.O. Shigehiro Komaru said, 'As a major logistics company in Japan, I feel it's our duty to make impactful campaigns to educate the local community about traffic safety. With the pears, we also distributed an informational brochure with tips to prevent accidents. Pulling together with the community to educate the youth is the key to save lives.'
