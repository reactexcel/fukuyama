            Four years ago Shigehiro Komaru, president and CEO of Fukuyama Transporting, was inspired to invite his family's Buddhist Monks, from their 360 year old temple, to begin praying in a monthly ritual in both his Tokyo and Hiroshima headquarters. Fukuyama Transporting is recognized internationally for having the latest in technology and safety standards in the automotive industry, but Komaru wanted to take a step further, incorporating the Japanese tradition of a prayer ritual for blessings of traffic safety.

            He choose to revive the prayer method 'Butsuji', which is the traditional form of prayer, that was replaced in the edo era with simple salt cleansing. This ceremony is very rarely seen nowadays but is considered to many as the truest and most powerful form of Buddhist prayer.
