         <h3>Third Mid-Term Plan</h3>
         <hr />
         <p>The Fukuyama Transporting group has launched two mid-term plans since FY2008 with the
            intention of strengthening the group's fundamentals. However, some of the targets identified have
            proven extremely difficult to attain in the prevailing severe business climate affecting the
            distribution industry. The industry faces the substantial challenges of driver shortage and high fuel
            prices, together with the costs involved in disaster preparedness. To achieve sustainable growth in
            these circumstances, the company launched its third mid-term business plan, aptly named
            Challenge, Change, and Connect Towards 2017, reflecting on the experience of the earlier plans and implementing the
            findings.<br><br>
            We believe that enhancing our corporate value cannot be achieved only by strengthening our
            management structure and improving our earnings performance. The satisfaction of all our
            stakeholders is also indispensible, and we have introduced four distinct policies to increase
            stakeholder engagement.
