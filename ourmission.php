         </p>
         <p>Under the leadership of its President & C.E.O. Shigehiro Komaru, Fukuyama Transporting utilizes the world's most advanced sorting machines with state of the art French technology. This large investment and civil support of French machines has lead President Komaru to receive the French Legion of Honor (Grand Officer) in October, 2017, the highest French order of merit for military and civil merits established by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802. 
            <br><br>
            With a global mind and wish to support the international community, President Shigehiro Komaru currently serves as the Honorary Consulate to the Republic of Lithuania in Fukuyama. He also holds deep roots within Japan and served as a member of NHK Board of Governors for eight years, during which he was the Board Chairman between 2008 and 2011.
