			<p><font color="green">Nagoya, Japan - October 16th, 2017</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Today, Fukuyama Transporting Co Ltd, a leading Japanese logistics company specializing in B2B (business-to-business) transporting, announced that they will be the first in Japan to begin using new state of the art 25 meter trucks, the largest trucks on the market. This is in efforts to decrease transportation costs to its customers and help handle the declining labor pools that Japanese companies are starting to feel. The new trucks will allow them to transport twice the amount of cargo per worker for long distance transportation. The new trucks will be provided by Isuzu manufacturing a leader in innovative truck design and are set to make their debut at the beginning of October, 2017 in Nagoya. 
			<br><br>
			With the purchase of the new 25 meter trucks, Fukuyama Transporting President and C.E.O. Shigehiro Komaru said, 'we are providing solutions to deal with the driver shortage, as well as to consider the environmental load and are proud to be the forerunner.'
