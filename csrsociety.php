         <p class="subtitlelarge">Cleaning up our roads</p>
         <br>
         <p>We rely on our roads every day and should not take them for granted. The company launched its 'amenity-clean' initiative in Fukuyama City on July 20, 1990 and has since extended it throughout the country.</p>
         <br>
         <p class="subtitlelarge">Disaster preparedness and distribution of emergency provisions</p>
         <br>
         <p>The company's extensive fleet of trucks, its distribution centers, fuel depots and other logistical resources extending across the whole country are of immense value whenever disaster strikes. For this reason, central and local government entrust Fukuyama Transport with the distribution of emergency and other provisions.  </p>

         <p class="subtitlelarge">Comprehensive ties with local governments</p>
         <br>
         <p>The company reached an agreement with Hiroshima Prefecture on June 14 2017 to distribute much of the prefecture's PR and disaster preparedness information. 
            <br><br>
            The major measures the company is undertaking include:
         </p>
         <br>
         <ul>
            <li>Placing large information stickers on the company's trucks</li>
            <li>Using its fresh produce delivery service to promote the prefecture's natural produce</li>
            <li>Providing its sales, operational and accommodation facilities in the event of disaster</li>
            <li>Placing seals on home delivery parcels to raise awareness of the dangers of fraud and deception. </li>
         </ul>
         <br><br>
         <p class="subtitlelarge">Preventing deception and unfair trading</p>
         <br>
         <p>The company shares information internally and cooperates with public organisations in order to fight the use of home delivery services for deception and unfair trading.</p>
